    Professor Gilbert Winestein is a renowned cybersecurity expert... and an even bigger wine enthusiast!
    His prized wine collection features exclusive bottles from the renowned vineyard Ch√¢teau AtHack.
    Every time he adds a new bottle, he struggles to check if it's already in his collection because comparing all the labels takes forever.
    To speed up the process, Winestein's friends suggested a clever hack: record the MD5 hash of each label.
    Since MD5 hashes are short, it would make his collection faster to manage.

    But you, a sharp and curious student of his, notice a potential flaw.
    What if two labels from different bottles accidentally produce the same MD5 hash? Winestein might think they're duplicates and toss out a unique wine!

    To convince him, you decide to demonstrate how two different labels can have the same MD5 hash but different SHA-256 hashes. Use this information to teach him why relying on MD5 alone might not be the best choice for such a prized collection.
